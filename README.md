<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>As me and my mentor went through the project, website works very well.</p>
<p>-Navbar works properly, if you click any option it will direct you to right title. Navbar stick on top and when it turn to hamburger
navigation bar and it is opened on each devices.</p>
<p>-All the images,logos and texts are set on CSS, they`re getting bigger or smaller depends and the size of the screen.</p>
<p>-As I`ve used Bootstrap to make my website responsive, it works on each devices well. If you open the webpage, click of right button of your mouse and click inspect then top of the page you can try it for each devices. </p>
<p>-Map and videos are responsive as well and you can try it with the same steps.</p>
<p>-Go to the "Contact Us" page and try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears or try to 
submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears</p>
<p>-Videos are taken from Youtube and if you click play button it will be opened in 2 seconds.</p>
<p>-When you click "x" button after you open information of one of the places on the map it will be closed on you can see the whole map</p>
<p>-You can make zoom in with "+" button and zoom out with "-" button</p>
<p>-Map and Satallite options work well. You can click them right top of the map</p>
<p>-DCG button make you refresh the page which means directs you to index.html</p>
<p>-Social media logos direct you to main pages of the logos as this is not a real services</p>
<p>*Only bug that I couldn`t solve is that on my screen videos looks little bit smaller than other sections. However on my mentor screen
it seems fine.</p>

However I made some changes after main structure was set and deployed all of them again. Lastly, by taking into consideration my project, I wrote
